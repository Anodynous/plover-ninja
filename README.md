## What does Plover Ninja do?

Plover Ninja notes the words that you write and how long it takes to write these words. Based on this information, it is able to do some neat analysis. The plugin can:

* Determine which words take the longest to write
* Determine which words you haven't ever written before

Based on this kind of information, Plover Ninja can make recommendations. In order for it's suggestions to be useful, Plover Ninja keeps in mind which words are used most frequently. With this information in mind, the plugin can suggest:

* Words that are worth practicing, because they are both slow *and* are fairly common
* The most common words that you have never written before

While there are several tools that can help you practice steno, Plover Ninja is unique in that all of its feedback is based on the things you actually write. If you write an email and hit a tricky word, Plover Ninja will see that and be able to point that out later. If you've never used a common word, Plover Ninja will point that out so that you can grow your vocabulary with useful words.
